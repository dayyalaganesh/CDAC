Insurance Claims because it gives us enough complexity to demonstrate joins, aggregations, partitions, incremental loading, data cleansing, and warehouse modeling.

---

## 1. Project scenario

Imagine an insurance company receives three daily files:

```
customers.csv
policies.csv
claims.csv
```

The files arrive on a Linux server.

Our job:

1. Load raw files into HDFS.
2. Create Hive external tables on the raw data.
3. Perform data-quality checks.
4. Transform data using Hive.
5. Create warehouse/dimensional tables.
6. Partition the warehouse tables.
7. Perform incremental loads.
8. Run business queries on the final warehouse.

### Technology

```
Linux
HDFS
Hive
SQL
Shell scripting

Optional:
Sqoop
Oozie
Spark
```

For your first version, don't add Spark/Sqoop/Oozie. Get HDFS + Hive working first.

## 3. Directory structure

On Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/insurance_etl
cd ~/insurance_etl

mkdir source
mkdir scripts
mkdir hive
mkdir logs
```

You'll have:

```

## 4. Source data

### `customers.csv`
```csv
customer_id,name,city,state,dob
101,Rahul,Bangalore,Karnataka,1998-04-10
102,Priya,Chennai,Tamil Nadu,1995-07-22
103,Amit,Mumbai,Maharashtra,1990-11-15
104,Sneha,Delhi,Delhi,1997-02-18
105,Arjun,Hyderabad,Telangana,1992-09-30
```

### `policies.csv`
```csv
policy_id,customer_id,policy_type,premium,start_date,end_date
P1001,101,Health,25000,2025-01-01,2025-12-31
P1002,102,Auto,18000,2025-02-01,2026-01-31

P1005,105,Auto,20000,2025-01-10,2025-12-31
```

### `claims.csv`
```csv

C006,P1001,2025-08-10,15000,Approved
```

## 5. Put files into HDFS

First create HDFS directories:

```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /insurance/raw/customers
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /insurance/raw/policies
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /insurance/raw/claims
```

Check:

```bash
hdfs dfs -ls /insurance/raw
```

Upload:

```bash
hdfs dfs -put source/customers.csv /insurance/raw/customers/
hdfs dfs -put source/policies.csv /insurance/raw/policies/
hdfs dfs -put source/claims.csv /insurance/raw/claims/
```

Verify:

```bash
hdfs dfs -ls -R /insurance
```

Read a file directly from HDFS:

```bash
hdfs dfs -cat /insurance/raw/customers/customers.csv
```

This is your Extract + Load into HDFS stage.

---

## 6. Create Hive databases

Start Hive:

```bash
hive
```

Or depending on your installation:

```bash
beeline
```

Create databases:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE insurance_raw;
CREATE DATABASE insurance_staging;
CREATE DATABASE insurance_dw;
```

Check:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

---

## 7. Create RAW Hive tables

This is important: Raw tables should generally be external tables. Why? Because Hive manages the metadata, but the underlying data remains in HDFS.

Create:

```sql
USE insurance_raw;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE customers_raw (
    customer_id INT,
    name STRING,
    city STRING,
    state STRING,
    dob STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/insurance/raw/customers';
```

Policies:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE policies_raw (
    policy_id STRING,
    customer_id INT,
    policy_type STRING,
    premium DOUBLE,
    start_date STRING,
    end_date STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/insurance/raw/policies';
```

Claims:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE claims_raw (
    claim_id STRING,
    policy_id STRING,
    claim_date STRING,
    claim_amount DOUBLE,
    status STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/insurance/raw/claims';
```

---

## 8. Verify RAW data

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers_raw;
SELECT * FROM policies_raw;
SELECT * FROM claims_raw;
```

Count:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers_raw;
```
Expected: `5`

Claims:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM claims_raw;
```
Expected: `6`

---

## 9. Problem: CSV header

In real ETL, your CSV has headers like:

```csv
customer_id,name,city,state,dob
```

Hive will interpret that as a data record unless you configure the table appropriately. Depending on your Hive version, use `TBLPROPERTIES`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers_raw
SET TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

ALTER TABLE policies_raw
SET TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");

ALTER TABLE claims_raw
SET TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
```

---

## 10. STAGING layer

Now we start transforming. Create staging tables.

```sql
USE insurance_staging;

CREATE TABLE customers_stg AS
SELECT
    customer_id,
    TRIM(name) AS name,
    TRIM(city) AS city,
    TRIM(state) AS state,
    CAST(dob AS DATE) AS dob
FROM insurance_raw.customers_raw
WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Now:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers_stg;
```

---

## 11. Transform policies

```sql
CREATE TABLE policies_stg AS
SELECT
    TRIM(policy_id) AS policy_id,
    customer_id,
    TRIM(policy_type) AS policy_type,
    CAST(premium AS DECIMAL(12,2)) AS premium,
    CAST(start_date AS DATE) AS start_date,
    CAST(end_date AS DATE) AS end_date
FROM insurance_raw.policies_raw
WHERE policy_id IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## 12. Transform claims

```sql
CREATE TABLE claims_stg AS
SELECT
    TRIM(claim_id) AS claim_id,
    TRIM(policy_id) AS policy_id,
    CAST(claim_date AS DATE) AS claim_date,
    CAST(claim_amount AS DECIMAL(12,2)) AS claim_amount,
    UPPER(TRIM(status)) AS status
FROM insurance_raw.claims_raw
WHERE claim_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Now your flow is:

```
HDFS → RAW Hive → STAGING Hive
```

---

## 13. Data-quality checks

This is where you show interviewers you understand real ETL.

### Duplicate claims
```sql
SELECT claim_id, COUNT(*)
FROM claims_stg
GROUP BY claim_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Negative claims
```sql
SELECT *
FROM claims_stg
WHERE claim_amount < 0;
```

### Invalid status
```sql
SELECT *
FROM claims_stg
WHERE status NOT IN ('APPROVED', 'REJECTED', 'PENDING');
```

### Orphan policies (Find policies without customers)
```sql
SELECT p.*
FROM policies_stg p
LEFT JOIN customers_stg c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id IS NULL;
```

### Orphan claims
```sql
SELECT c.*
FROM claims_stg c
LEFT JOIN policies_stg p ON c.policy_id = p.policy_id
WHERE p.policy_id IS NULL;
```

These are excellent interview examples.

---

## 14. Create the Data Warehouse

Now comes the important part. We create a star schema.

```
                 dim_customer
                      |
                      |
dim_policy ---- fact_claim ---- dim_date
```

* **Fact:** `fact_claim`
* **Dimensions:** `dim_customer`, `dim_policy`, `dim_date`

---

## 15. Customer dimension

```sql
USE insurance_dw;

CREATE TABLE dim_customer (
    customer_key BIGINT,
    customer_id INT,
    customer_name STRING,
    city STRING,
    state STRING,
    dob DATE
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

Load:

```sql
INSERT INTO dim_customer
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY customer_id) AS customer_key,
    customer_id,
    name,
    city,
    state,
    dob
FROM insurance_staging.customers_stg;
```

Check:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dim_customer;
```

---

## 16. Policy dimension

```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_policy (
    policy_key BIGINT,
    policy_id STRING,
    customer_id INT,
    policy_type STRING,
    premium DECIMAL(12,2),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

Load:

```sql
INSERT INTO dim_policy
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY policy_id) AS policy_key,
    policy_id,
    customer_id,
    policy_type,
    premium,
    start_date,
    end_date
FROM insurance_staging.policies_stg;
```

---

## 17. Date dimension

```sql
CREATE TABLE dim_date (
    date_key INT,
    full_date DATE,
    year INT,
    month INT,
    day INT
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

You can populate it using Hive date-generation logic, or initially load a prepared calendar file. Having a date dimension lets you answer questions like *"How many claims occurred per month?"* without repeatedly deriving date attributes.

---

## 18. Create the FACT table

```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_claim (
    claim_key BIGINT,
    claim_id STRING,
    customer_key BIGINT,
    policy_key BIGINT,
    date_key INT,
    claim_amount DECIMAL(12,2),
    status STRING,
    claim_to_premium_ratio DECIMAL(15,4)
)
PARTITIONED BY (
    claim_year INT
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

---

## 19. Load the fact table

Join staging data with dimensions:

```sql
INSERT INTO fact_claim
PARTITION (claim_year)
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY c.claim_id) AS claim_key,
    c.claim_id,
    dc.customer_key,
    dp.policy_key,
    CAST(DATE_FORMAT(c.claim_date, 'yyyyMMdd') AS INT) AS date_key,
    c.claim_amount,
    c.status,
    CAST(c.claim_amount / dp.premium AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS claim_to_premium_ratio,
    YEAR(c.claim_date) AS claim_year
FROM insurance_staging.claims_stg c
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_policy dp ON c.policy_id = dp.policy_id
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_customer dc ON dp.customer_id = dc.customer_id;
```

---

## 20. Check the warehouse

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim;
SELECT * FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim;
```

Partition check:

```sql
SHOW PARTITIONS insurance_dw.fact_claim;
```

You should see something like `claim_year=2025`.

---

## 21. Business queries

### Total approved claims by insurance type
```sql
SELECT
    p.policy_type,
    SUM(f.claim_amount) AS total_claim_amount
FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim f
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_policy p ON f.policy_key = p.policy_key
WHERE f.status = 'APPROVED'
GROUP BY p.policy_type;
```

### Claims by state
```sql
SELECT
    c.state,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    SUM(f.claim_amount) AS total_claim_amount
FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim f
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_customer c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
GROUP BY c.state
ORDER BY total_claim_amount DESC;
```

### Monthly claims
```sql
SELECT
    d.year,
    d.month,
    COUNT(*) AS claim_count,
    SUM(f.claim_amount) AS total_claim_amount
FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim f
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_date d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
GROUP BY d.year, d.month
ORDER BY d.year, d.month;
```

### Claim-to-premium analysis
```sql
SELECT
    p.policy_type,
    SUM(f.claim_amount) AS claims,
    SUM(p.premium) AS premium,
    SUM(f.claim_amount) / SUM(p.premium) AS claim_premium_ratio
FROM insurance_dw.fact_claim f
JOIN insurance_dw.dim_policy p ON f.policy_key = p.policy_key
GROUP BY p.policy_type;
```

---

## 22. Incremental ETL

Suppose today's source contains new records (`C007`, `C008`, `C009`). Instead of reprocessing all historical claims, create an HDFS directory based on load date:

```
/insurance/raw/claims/
    load_date=2025-09-01/
    load_date=2025-09-02/
    load_date=2025-09-03/
```

Upload:

```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /insurance/raw/claims/load_date=2025-09-02
hdfs dfs -put claims_20250902.csv /insurance/raw/claims/load_date=2025-09-02/
```

Then Hive can process the new partition, enabling incremental loads rather than full table reloads.

---

## 23. Why Parquet?

The raw layer can remain `CSV / TEXT`, but the warehouse should use `PARQUET` because Parquet is columnar and optimized for analytical query workloads.

## 25. Interview talking points

When asked *"Explain your project"*, you can say:

> "I worked on an insurance claims ETL pipeline where the source data was available as CSV files. We first loaded the raw files into HDFS. In Hive, I created external tables over the raw data so that the raw files remained managed independently from Hive metadata.
>
> We then created a staging layer where we performed cleansing, datatype conversions, duplicate checks, null handling and referential-integrity checks.
>
> After that, we transformed the data using Hive SQL and loaded it into a dimensional data warehouse. We created customer and policy dimensions and a claims fact table. The warehouse tables were stored in Parquet and the fact table was partitioned by year to improve query performance.
>
> Finally, we used Hive SQL to generate analytical metrics such as claim amount by policy type, claims by state and monthly claim trends. For incremental processing, we organized incoming data by load date and processed only the new data."
